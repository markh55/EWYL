# EarnWhileYouLearn (EWYL)

This site is aimed at getting adults into worked based learning to gain valuable skills for them and the employers, This is achieved beyond the traditional methods as learners get to gain hands on experience in their chosen section but still obtain a qualification at the end of the apprenticeship.

My aim for this website is to be inviting and simple to use but also deliver enough information to get the learner / employer to reach out and make contact with us so we can pair them with the perfect learner / employer to meet each otherâ€™s needs.

   * As a potential user i would like the site to have a user friendly navigation so anyone can use your site with ease.
   * As a potential user the site needs to have a good selection of available courses that im able to sign up too.
   * I would like to see a clear but useful contact us form with navigation from the courses page.
   * When using your site i would like to see images with the courses along with detailed descriptions.
   * I would like to have the option to sign up to weekly/monthly newsletters to keep up with all the latest news and what is on offer.

### Aims

   * To provide a simple and userfriendly website to navigate.
   * To have a contact us section so a clear line of contact is available.
