# EarnWhileYouLearn (EWYL)

This site is aimed at getting adults into worked based learning to gain valuable skills for them and the employers, This is achieved beyond the traditional methods as learners get to gain hands on experience in their chosen section but still obtain a qualification at the end of the apprenticeship.

My aim for this website is to be inviting and simple to use but also deliver enough information to get the learner / employer to reach out and make contact with us so we can pair them with the perfect learner / employer to meet each other’s needs.

 ## Planning

### Target Audiences
   * People looking to gain reconised qualifications while earning.
   * Employers looking for apprentice to show and guide them through this learning journey.

### User Stories
   
   * As a potential user i would like the site to have a user friendly navigation so anyone can use your site with ease.
   * As a potential user the site needs to have a good selection of available courses that im able to sign up too.
   * I would like to see a clear but useful contact us form with navigation from the courses page.
   * When using your site i would like to see images with the courses along with detailed descriptions.
   * I would like to have the option to sign up to weekly/monthly newsletters to keep up with all the latest news and what is on offer.

### Aims
   * To provide clear information on what courses are available.
   * To provide a simple and userfriendly website to navigate.
   * To have a contact us section so a clear line of contact is available.
   * To have clear information on what an apprenticship intails on the home page but not too much information to overload the user
     
## How to achieved this
   * The navigation bar will be clean and simplified containing only the pages and logo
   * The home page will have the following an Hero image, About us and who we are section and a Is an apprentiship right for you section
   * Page two will be the courses page that will contain a breif intro to each course along with a photo.
   * Page three will be the contact us page that will contain a form to request a call back and leave a message.

Reason for design - I went with a basice yet responsive design that will be inviting to all users of the website aswell as giving all the relevent information.
 
## Colour Scheme

![Colour Scheme (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a3b91fc-59a6-4c75-9a7b-6f1169675890)

This is the colour scheme i went with as i feel the contrast compliment each other.


## Final Design

## Deployment

### Repository

•	I made public local repository on my Github account, I then linked my repository to my Gitpod account and start building.

•	When writing my code I ensured that I committed my changes to the repository using clear and direct messages for any changes such as “linked Style.css file to index.HTML” this is done by doing the following;
In the terminal type;
* git add .
* git commit -m “Enter message here”
* git push

I would send a commit after each change then I would push the file once ive made 3 or 4 changes.


### Hosting

This is how I will host my website, On Github I Selected my Earn While You Learn (EWYL) 
Repository, then go to;
* Settings
* Pages

  
Once on the pages site I would ensure the following settings was applied;
	Source would need to be set to ‘Deploy from branch’
	Branch will need to be set to main and then root. 
	Save.
